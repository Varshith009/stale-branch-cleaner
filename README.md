# 🚀 Stale Branch Cleaner (AI Ready)

Automatically deletes branches older than **30 days** daily using GitHub Actions.

## 🔧 Setup

1. Go to your repository **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` — your GitHub PAT (with `repo` access)
   - `TARGET_REPO` — your repo name in the form `username/repo-name`

## 📅 How It Works

- Runs daily at midnight UTC
- Fetches all branches
- Checks each branch’s latest commit date
- If older than 30 days, deletes it (except `main` or `master`)

## 🛡️ Safety

- `main` and `master` branches are always ignored
- Logs deletion activity in Actions run logs

## 📥 Manual Trigger

You can manually run this workflow via **Actions tab** → `Delete Stale Branches` → `Run workflow`

## 🧠 AI Extension Ready

Optionally integrate LangChain AI decision logic in `tools/branch_cleanup.py` if you want dynamic AI-based deletion rules.
